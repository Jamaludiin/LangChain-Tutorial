# a simple, straightforward example of using BaseMessage with Groq. However, note that we typically use the specific message types (like HumanMessage or AIMessage) rather than BaseMessage directly.

"""
Why This Fix Works
BaseMessage is abstract, meaning it cannot be used directly.
HumanMessage represents user input, and AIMessage represents AI-generated responses.
The error "Got unknown type" happens because BaseMessage is not recognized by _convert_message_to_dict.
Try this updated code, and it should work without issues! ðŸš€
